    description: "The Rivian R1S is an all-electric, seven-passenger, full-size off-road SUV manufactured by Rivian. Built on the same skateboard platform as the R1T pickup truck (sharing 91% of components), the R1S debuted as a prototype at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November 2018 and entered production in 2021, with customer deliveries beginning in late August 2022 after 10 years of development. The R1S features a distinctive design with a full-width horizontal light bar at the front, vertical oval headlights, and clean minimalist body panels. It measures 200.8 inches in length with a 121.1-inch wheelbase and offers a turning circle nearly 4 feet smaller than the R1T due to its shorter wheelbase and rear overhang. Initially launched with a quad-motor powertrain (one motor per wheel) developed by Bosch, delivering 835 horsepower and 908 lb-ft of torque, enabling 0-60 mph acceleration in approximately 3 seconds. The lineup expanded to include dual-motor variants starting in 2024 using Rivian's in-house 'Enduro' motors, with a Performance Dual-Motor option added in April 2023 that raises output through software modification. Battery options include a 105 kWh Standard pack (LFP chemistry, delayed until 2024), 135 kWh Large pack, and a 149 kWh Max pack (delayed until 2023). EPA-rated range is up to 410 miles with the Max pack and quad-motor configuration. The adaptive air suspension provides up to 14.9 inches of ground clearance with a maximum wading depth of 3 feet, and includes a Camp Mode for leveling on irregular terrain. Interior features include a 16-inch central touchscreen, 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, panoramic glass roof (without sunshade), sustainable vegan leather seats, and a gear tunnel behind the rear seats with an integrated air compressor. Trim levels include the Adventure package with heated/cooled perforated vegan leather seats and a Meridian Audio sound system, while the base Explore package was discontinued in August 2022 citing low demand. The R1S achieved IIHS TOP SAFETY PICK+ status for the 2023 model year."
