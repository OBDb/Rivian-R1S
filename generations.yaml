    description: "The Rivian R1S is the SUV variant of Rivian's inaugural consumer vehicle lineup, launched as a three-row, seven-passenger all-electric adventure vehicle. Built on Rivian's skateboard platform shared with the R1T pickup, the R1S features a distinctive design language with a horizontal light bar spanning the full width of the front end, vertical oval headlights, and clean, minimalist body panels. Measuring 200.8 inches in length with a 121.1-inch wheelbase, the R1S offers SUV practicality with electric performance and off-road capability. Initially available with a quad-motor powertrain delivering 835 horsepower and 908 lb-ft of torque (one motor per wheel), the R1S can accelerate from 0-60 mph in as little as 3 seconds while providing precise torque vectoring for enhanced on and off-road handling. The lineup later expanded to include dual-motor variants with approximately 600 horsepower. Battery options include 105 kWh (Standard), 135 kWh (Large), and 180 kWh (Max) packs, offering EPA-estimated ranges of approximately 260, 316, and 390 miles respectively, depending on configuration. The adaptive air suspension provides up to 15 inches of ground clearance and can ford water up to 3 feet deep, while the sophisticated off-road mode selector optimizes the vehicle for different terrains. Inside, the R1S features a premium interior with sustainable materials, a panoramic glass roof, a 16-inch central touchscreen, and a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster. Innovative features include a gear tunnel behind the rear seats, a built-in air compressor, and multiple 110V outlets for powering external devices. Advanced driver assistance is provided through Rivian's Driver+ system, which includes adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, and automatic emergency braking, with the hardware capability for future autonomous driving features via over-the-air updates. The R1S represents Rivian's vision for the future of adventure vehicles, combining electric performance, technology, and capability in a package aimed at outdoor enthusiasts and families seeking a sustainable alternative to traditional SUVs."
